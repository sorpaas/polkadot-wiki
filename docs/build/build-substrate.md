[Substrate Connect](https://substrate.io/substrate-connect/) is a JavaScript library and 
browser extension that builds on the Polkadot-JS API to enable developers to build 
application-specific light clients for Substrate chains. 

## Replacing [RPC Nodes](build-node-interaction.md) with Light Clients

Application developers no longer need to rely on single RPC nodes to allow end-users to interact 
with their applications. 

### Blockchain User Interfaces are still Centralized

The communication between a standard user interface (UI) and a network node are through an RPC 
protocol. Generally, the UI will showcase the information that is available on the node, and 
this is done through two main approaches:

1. User-Controlled Nodes: The UI connects to a node client that the user has installed on their 
   machine.
   - These nodes are secure, but installation and maintenance of these nodes tends to be an inconvenience.
2. Publicly-Accessible Nodes: The UI connects to a third-party-owned publicly-accessible node client.
   - While these nodes are more prevalent in their usage as they are convenient to use, they are centralized 
     and insecure.

There is now a new paradigm: instead of specifying a centralized RPC node, developers just need to 
define the blockchain's [chain specification](https://docs.substrate.io/v3/runtime/chain-specs/) for 
their application to synchronize with the chain.

### Node Bundled with User Interface

The UI connects to a node client that is directly integrated: **convenient**, **secure**, and 
**decentralized**. This is accomplished through Substrate connect using a 
[smoldot](https://github.com/paritytech/smoldot/) Wasm light client 
to securely connect to the blockchain network without relying on specific third parties.

Application developers can now run a Substrate light client in any NodeJS environment 
([@substrate/connect](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@substrate/connect)), as well as 
in-browser applications and extensions, Electron apps, IoT devices, and mobile phones.

#### Two key features

1. **Ready-to-use light clients** for Substrate chains: Currently, Substrate Connect supports Polkadot, 
   Kusama, Westend, and Rococo; because light clients are part of the overall Substrate framework, they 
   are available for Substrate-based blockchains.
2. **Bundling light-clients** of multiple chains: The 
   [browser extension](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@substrate/connect-extension-protocol) allows 
   end-users to interact with applications connected to multiple blockchains or connect their own 
   blockchains to applications that support it.
